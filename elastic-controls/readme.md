# Elastic Controls

### Objective

Create a draggable control that has triggered behaviour at a definable point with the node's range of movement.

Make the node generic enough that it can be dropped into an existing program with minor configuartion.

Explore giving the node an elastic feel. As the node reaches the outer limits of its movement range slow the movement to give a feeling of resistance. On release, animate the node moving back to its original position with similar movement.
